To do this requires us to </span><span class="c2 c1">reduce inefficiency and put the power and </span><span class="c1">consequently</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;the responsibility back into the hands of the common person. The current economic and sociopolitical systems currently in use </span><span class="c1">feedback</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;on each other to reward both waste and the consolidation of power. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current dominant ideology in the world is not religious, it&#39;s not political it is economical and that ideology is Capitalism. The Capitalist system uses the corporation and its hierarchical organization to concentrate resources a.k.a wealth a.k.a. capital to the top tiers of the hierarchy. Along with its hierarchical structure it is an open linear system by which concentration of wealth at the top is equaled by concentration of pollution at the bottom, this is contradictory to the closed loop cyclical system that is the ecology of the biosphere. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalism is also highly competitive. Workers compete with other workers to get the best paying job. Once you have a job you compete to move up the hierarchy to gain status and wealth and the &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; of bossing other people around. If you are lucky enough to make it to the top of your corporation you then compete with other corporations for market share and these markets then compete with other markets.</span></p><p class="c7 c13"><span class="c1">Several things are not commonly known about corporations. The first of these is that nation states are corporations, &nbsp;when you pledge your allegiance to your country it is no morally different than pledging it to Walmart or Monsanto yet not many would accept dieing for or accepting to be taxed by these corporations. Municipalities are corporations and this gives the minority that incorporates it legal power to control the activities, even lock them in cages with their police force and collect taxes of its residences within its jurisdiction. Again would we accept a Walmart employee putting us into a cage or evicting us from our home if we failed to pay our taxes? The Federal Reserve bank is a private corporation with the same incentive placed upon it as any other and that is the legal requirement to make a profit for its shareholders, who are the Federal Government of the United States (remember, another corporation) and the list of shareholders whose numbers and names have been kept secret since the Fed&#39;s founding in 1913. The central banking system of the world controls the money supply. This false wealth, this worthless resource, is the tool by which real resources are extracted from Mother Earth and then abused by the minority that sits at the top. Please ask this simple question: who is the national debts of countries around the world owed to exactly and why? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c13"><span class="c1">This competitive hierarchical structure is the root cause of both our social and environmental problems. Even though we have talked about Capitalism this hierarchical societal organization has existed since the beginnings of civilization. Some question whether civilization is compatible with ecology. We believe it is as long as civilization is organized in an ecological way. Therefore the REGENCO-OP is structured as an anarchical organization, that is, as voluntary free association co-operative that is unincorporated. We are a place for people who want to take on the responsibility and reap the rewards of insuring theirs, their children&#39;s and grandchildren&rsquo;s etc. sustainable existence. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7 c13"><span class="c14 c5">We know that we must </span><span class="c5 c11">co-operate to regenerate life</span><span class="c5 c14">!</span></p><p class="c7 c13"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c1">Current areas of focus</span><span class="c2 c1">:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2 c0">* Using the &nbsp;principles of a </span><span class="c0">voluntary</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;free association co-operative and the tools provided by the internet &nbsp;develop an </span><span class="c0">organizational</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;system that allows the Mission of REGenCo-op to be realized.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* To create a completely renewable and environmentally balanced power production, storage and usage system that is scale</span><span class="c0">able</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;to the average suburban USA household, farm homestead, small business a</span><span class="c0">nd ecovillage</span><span class="c2 c0">.
